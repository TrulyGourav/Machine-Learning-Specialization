Question 1: 

For linear regression, the model is fw,b(x)=wx+bfw,bâ€‹(x)=wx+b.

Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?

-> x


Question 2:

For linear regression, if you find parameters ww and bb so that J(w,b)J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?


-> The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.
